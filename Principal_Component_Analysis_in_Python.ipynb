    "There are multiple ways to optimize you machine learning models. A common way is to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset. You can do it via Feature Selection. A more common way of speeding up a machine learning algorithm is by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). If your learning algorithm is too slow because the input dimension is too high, then using PCA to speed it up can be a reasonable choice. This is probably the most common application of PCA. Another common application of PCA is for data visualization.\n",

That is why we use advanced techniques such as [autoencoders](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/autoencoder-classifier-python) for the same dimension reduction purposes.
